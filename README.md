Python Visualizations in Jupyter Notebook


This project demonstrates advanced Python visualizations using popular libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, and Folium.

The notebook covers multiple visualization techniques for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), interactive dashboards, animated plots, and geospatial analysis.
